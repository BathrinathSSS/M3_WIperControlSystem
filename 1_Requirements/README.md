## Aim :
To prevent the accidents during rain and wet conditions.

## Research :
Application is researched from various resources like from Google, YouTube and from Research Papers and then developed a model under the name wiper control system.
.
## End Goal :
1.Avoid accidents and provide a safety transport environment.

2.Clean vision in weather conditions.

# 4'W',1'H' :
